# Description

An Anki add-on that adds a "Rebuild All" button to the bottom of the main screen,
to rebuild all filtered decks at once.

# Support

Post a [new issue on Github](https://github.com/Arthaey/anki-rebuild-all/issues/new)
(or make a pull request!).

[My other Anki add-ons](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AArthaey+anki)
are also on Github.

# TODO

- add config for individual decks to "opt out" of rebuild-all
