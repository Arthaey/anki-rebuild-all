# Description

**Anki download ID: `1639597619`**

An Anki add-on that adds "Rebuild All" and "Empty All" buttons to the bottom of
the main screen, to rebuild or empty all filtered decks at once.

# Support

Post a [new issue on Github](https://github.com/Arthaey/anki-rebuild-all/issues/new)
(or make a pull request!). You can also write a review or ask questions on the
[Anki website for shared add-ons](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1639597619).

[My other Anki add-ons](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AArthaey+anki)
are also on Github.

# TODO

- add config for individual decks to "opt out" of rebuild-all
